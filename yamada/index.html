	  <h2>Short Bio</h2>
	  <p>
	    Hiroshi Yamada heads the Advanced Systems Group of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. His research focuses on system software solutions to enhance effectivity, availability, reliability and security of real-world computer systems. Current hardware and software are complicated enough to make it quite difficult and almost impossible to eliminate all the faults in their development phase. The complication also causes behavior conflicts between software layers (application-, OS-, and VMM-layer), leading to significant performance degradation.<br><br>

 To address these challenges, he takes an approach (i) to quantitatively analyzing behavior of real-life system software, (ii) to exploring novel resource management for achieving high performance and energy-efficiency, (iii) to developing system software supports for gracefully handling failures at runtime, (iv) to designing OS- and VMM-level mechanisms for efficiently controlling brand new hardware devices.<br><br>

	    In the past, Hiroshi was a project assistant professor at Keio University from 2009 to 2012. Also, he was a visiting scholar at Duke University in 2012. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Keio University in 2009 and his B.E. and M.E. in computer science from The University of Electro-Communications in 2004 and 2006, respectively. He received several awards from Information Processing Society of Japan (Best-Paper Award[2013, 2010, 2009], Yamashita-SIG Award[2008], etc.).
