	    <p>Advanced Systems Group (ASG) at TUAT performs a broad range of systems software research. Of particular interests are systems software (e.g. operating systems, virtual machine monitors, databases, etc.) design and implementation for dependable computing, bigdata processing, and cloud computing. ASG investigates pragmatic solutions applicable to real-world software consisting of millions of lines of code and brand new hardware devices.</p>

    <p>Computer systems have become an infrastructure of our daily life. However, their dependability is NOT as high as other infrastructures such as water and gases. The lack of the dependability causes various failures including system stops and sensitive information leaks/lost. Our group, ASG, focuses on system software, which is the basic layer to control application programs and hardware devices. ASG researches system software technologies for attaining the dependability of computer systems. </p>

    <h3>Effective/Efficient Resource Management</h3>
    <p>The primary goal of  system software is to control applications and hardware devices in a proper way that makes maximum use of  their characteristics. If system software fails to achieve the goal, the quality of the services significantly lowers , resulting in decreasing the number of users of the services. ASG researches resource management policies and mechanisms of system software for emerging applications and ever-changing hardware devices. Our current focus is on efficient and effective management of bigdata processing, cloud services, many-core processors, and non-volatile memory.</p>

    <h3>Novel Virtualization</h3>
    <p>The use of system virtualization is common in not only data centers but end-users computers such as desktops, laptops, and embedded systems. ASG explores the potentiality of virtualization to dramatically make our computing environments more dependable, efficient, and user-friendly. The group investigates how to virtualize new hardware devices and support emerging applications through system virtualization. Our research expands applicability of system virtualization and shows its new applications. </p>

    <h3>Gracefully Handling Software/Hardware Failures</h3>
    <p>Recent hardware devices are so complicated that their failures are difficult to deal with. The devices fail in diverse manners, rather than a "fail-stop" manner;  the devices operate even if a portion of them is failed, leading unstable behavior of software running on them. In addition, software consists of millions of lines  of code, so eliminating bugs, i.e. concurrency bugs and heisen bugs, in its development phase is almost impossible. ASG seeks execution mechanisms that assume software/hardware failures occur in a service operation. The group investigates system software supports to gracefully handle software/hardware failures. </p>

    <h3>Deep Analysis of System Software Behavior</h3>
    <p>It is quite difficult to completely understand and model system software behavior because it consists of different components and depends largely on computing environments; it is easy to cause anomalous performance and unstable quality of services. ASG deeply analyzes system software behavior from various view points. Our analysis is performed in a pragmatic way that observes execution of target software with different workloads/platforms. The results sheds light on not only future system software design but next-generation hardware architecture. </p>
