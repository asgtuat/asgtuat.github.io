	    <p>Advanced Systems Group (ASG) at TUAT performs a broad range of systems software research. Of particular interests are systems software (e.g. operating systems, virtual machine monitors, databases, etc.) design and implementation for dependable computing, bigdata processing, and cloud computing. ASG investigates pragmatic solutions applicable to real-world software consisting of millions of lines of code and brand new hardware devices.</p>

    <p>Although computer systems have become an infrastructure of our daily life, various failures including system stops and sensitive information leaks/lost are reported even now. ASG focuses on system software, which is the basic layer to control application programs and hardware devices, and researches system software technologies for attaining the dependability of computer systems.</p>

    <h3>Recovery-oriented Mechanisms against Software/Hardware Failures</h3>
    <p>Recent hardware devices are so complicated that their failures are difficult to deal with. The devices fail in diverse manners, rather than a "fail-stop" manner; the devices operate even if a portion of them is failed, leading unstable behavior of software running on them. In addition, software consists of millions of lines of code, so eliminating bugs, i.e., concurrency bugs and heisen bugs, in its development phase is almost impossible. Accepting the existence of such errors, ASG investigates software mechanisms that enforces system software to survive even software/hardware failures by gracefully handling them at runtime.</br></p>

    <h3>Novel Virtualization</h3>
    <p>The use of system virtualization is common in not only data centers but end-users computers such as desktops, laptops, and embedded systems. ASG explores the potentiality of virtualization to dramatically make our computing environments more dependable, efficient, and user-friendly. We seek how to virtualize new hardware devices and support modern applications through system virtualization. Our research expands the applicability of system virtualization and shows its new applications.</p>

    <h3>Effective/Efficient Resource Management Policies/Mechanisms</h3>
    <p>The primary goal of system software is to control applications and hardware devices in an effective way. ASG researches resource management policies and mechanisms of system software for emerging applications and ever-changing hardware devices. Our focus is on efficient and effective management of bigdata processing, cloud services, and non-volatile memory.</p>
